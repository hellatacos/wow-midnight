------------

## normal beta testing notes

- hero on pull
- two target + hectic add cleave

- dont share health, >10% health disparity they get pissy
- tank apart
- big breath cone targets random person, aim away from raid
- tank gets null beam, aim away from raid
- everyone gets small circle that spawns small add
  - stack near but not on each other
- giant orb spawns, tethers to players and pulls
  - break tether
- ezzorak summons a planet from mouth, players need to soak till blue
  - aim orb not at old area of denial
  - moves across room, puts area of denial on ground when hits edge
  - if not blue, area of denial fuckin huge
  - players might not be able to soak two in a row
- intermission, stand in barrier
  - kill add
  - get to edge of barrier with purple shit
    - these will continue to happen in next p1 till add dead
- back to p1, fight repeats
